# Computer Architecture - CSE UniWA Course 2024-2025
A brief showcase of the curriculum:

• **General concepts**, computing systems today and computer technology.  
• **Data representation methods** - signed and unsigned integers, floating point numbers, characters.  
• **Computer arithmetic** for integers and real numbers.  
• **Computer performance** and its evaluation measures.  
• **Instruction Set Architectures (ISA)** - RISC (e.g. MIPS), CISC (e.g. Intel x86) - instruction format, instruction repertoire, addressing methods with particular emphasis on the indexed method as it is applied to lists and arrays, pseudo instructions.  
• **Assembly language and machine language** - programming at the assembly language level, instruction fetching - execution, stack organization and subroutines, assembler, linker, debugger.  
• Single-cycle processor - **datapath design**.  

**Lab**:  
The course lab covers the instruction set architecture and symbolic language programming of the MIPS processor, using the MARS simulator.  

The first few lab courses were introductory and mostly about how the memory of MIPS works.  
From the 4th course onwards we started writing code.
